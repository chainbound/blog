TLDR; This article analyzes various key Ethereum network metrics to measure the
impact of PeerDAS and increasing blob counts. These metrics include block + blob
validation latency, attestation rates, and orphan rates. We find a clear
correlation between higher blob counts with PeerDAS, and a negative change in
said metrics ([link to results summary](#summary-of-results)), and argue that
especially with the competitive and latency-sensitive dynamics of PBS, this may
impose artificial blob limits that are below any protocol-defined limits. In
response to these issues, we outline a design for a network of supernodes that
we want to build to help alleviate some of them.

## Introduction

**PeerDAS**. Ethereum recently deployed Fusaka, an important milestone of its
rollup-centric roadmap, which introduces
[PeerDAS](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7594) as its first set of features
enabling data availability sampling (DAS). The concrete goal of PeerDAS is to
help the network sustain a much higher number of blobs per block. The network
supported a blob (target, max) of (6, 9) before Fusaka’s deployment and is
expected to support up to (48, 72) hopefully
[within 2026](https://stokes.io/blob-scaling-fyi). PeerDAS heavily modifies blob
mechanics; it changes how blobs are created, referenced, disseminated/custodied,
and verified. PeerDAS therefore naturally raises trade-offs.

**The limitations of DAS**. While validators no longer have to download and
verify full blobs thanks to PeerDAS, proposers do however have to perform more
computation and have to upload more data. With PeerDAS, blobs are now encoded
using Reed-Solomon, resulting in encoded blobs that are twice the size of
pre-PeerDAS blobs (128 kB → 256 kB). The block proposer organizes the encoded
blobs of a block as a 2D matrix where each blob is a row of the matrix. The
matrix is split into 128 columns by the proposer who computes a
[KZG commitment](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/master/specs/fulu/polynomial-commitments-sampling.md)
per column and disseminates each column separately to each of the 128
sub-networks of validators. Proposers do have to compute and upload more data
per block compared to before PeerDAS, mostly because of Reed-Solomon encoding.
This problem will be exacerbated as more blobs are added per block with the
rollout of BPOs. Some [notable proposals](https://ethresear.ch/t/22298) for the
future of DAS, including [FullDAS](https://ethresear.ch/t/19529) and
[FullDASv2](https://ethresear.ch/t/22477), are aiming for 2D encoding which
further doubles the overhead due to encoding, hence further worsen the bandwidth
cost for builders, proposers, and relays and its impact on dissemination latency
for all validators.

**Empirical analysis**. This document mainly includes an analysis of the impact
of blob count per block on Ethereum thanks to the observations recorded in
ethPandaOps’ [Xatu database](https://ethpandaops.io/data/xatu/). Namely, the
analysis studies the impact of blob count on (1) **block & blob reception
latency for validators**, (2) **successful attestation rate by validators**, and
(3) **the probability of a block to not be finalized and to be orphaned
instead**. The measurements are made on

1. Mainnet pre-PeerDAS deployment to serve as a baseline with a blob count of
   `(6, 9)`
2. Mainnet post-PeerDAS and BPO1 hence with a blob count of `(10, 15)`
3. Hoodi post-PeerDAS and BPO2 with blob count of `(14, 21)`

**Results [[summary table](#summary-of-results)]**. **Increasing the blob count
incurs a clear worsening of both block latency and attestation rate** on almost
all observed networks, both before and after PeerDAS alike. Additionally, we
observed a worse tail latency after PeerDAS compared to before, and the tail
latency increasingly worsens as the blob count increases. However, increasing
the blob count has no noticeable impact on the orphan rate; some results are
inconclusive and overall more data is required to have a meaningful conclusion
regarding orphan rate.

**Proposal:** 🌱 **Seeding network**. Considering the results of the analysis,
we propose to add a network of specialized supernodes into the Ethereum network
with the goal of speeding up the propagation of blocks, blobs, and blob columns
from block proposers (the relays in PBS) to the rest of the network. This added
service will act like a training-wheels network, ensuring specialized actors in
the PBS supply chain don’t start artificially limiting blob counts due to the
risk of including them, as discussed in
[this presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmu2222iQjc).

## Blob Count Empirical Analysis

The impact of blobs on some of these metrics can already be observed in the
Ethereum networks today. The following analysis highlights our main observations
related to the number of blobs present per block and shows that there is still
room for improvement after PeerDAS’ deployment.

### Analysis Scope

This analysis focuses on the following questions. Does increasing the blob count
impact:

1. The time required for validators to receive blocks and required blob columns?
2. The ability for validators to attest to blocks by the 4s deadline?
3. The probability of a block to end up orphaned?

### Analysis Structure

We study four combinations of networks and forks with four different blob
counts:

1. Mainnet under the Pectra fork with a stable network of
   [20,000 nodes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15388) and supporting a
   `(target, max)` of `(6, 9)` blobs. This dataset serves as a pre-PeerDAS
   baseline.
2. Mainnet under the Fusaka fork with PeerDAS and BPO1 activated to support a
   blob count of `(10, 15)`. We observed a noticeable reduction in noise after
   BPO1 activation so we opted to not include the data before it, i.e., the
   first week of Fusaka data. This dataset serves as a stable post-PeerDAS case
   study.
3. The Hoodi testnet under the Fusaka fork, with PeerDAS, run by
   [2,000 nodes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15388) with BPO2 activated to
   support a blob count of `(14, 21)`. This network is less stable and smaller
   than Mainnet but already has BPO2 activated. As a testnet, Hoodi’s
   architecture is closest to Mainnet which makes it preferable to study than
   Sepolia. This dataset serves as a case study with PeerDAS and BPO2.

### Setup

**Sources**: All the results are extracted from the Xatu database maintained by
ethPandaOps. The exact queries used to obtain the plots are publicly accessible
for reproduction in https://github.com/chainbound/blob-seeder-data.

**Plots**: Some plots use a box-and-whisker representation to depict the
distribution of results. The boxes are classic: the ends of the boxes represent
the 25th and 75th percentiles (noted p25 and p75) and the bar inside each box
represents the median (p50). The following plots include two pairs of whiskers
to better depict tail latency behaviors; the whiskers represent p1 and p5 on one
end and p95 and p99 on the other. Outliers are half-transparent colored circles
outside of the whiskers’ range. The box-and-whisker parameters are reminded in
the top right corner of the plots.

- **Latency: Clear impact of blob count on latency.**
  - When comparing latency before and after PeerDAS for blocks with the same
    blob count, the data shows that, even for low blob counts of 3 to 9,
    **PeerDAS has improved validation latency for 95% of validators on Mainnet
    compared to Pectra but worsened it for the remaining minority. However,
    blocks are disseminated faster with PeerDAS than without, which indicates
    that the dissemination of blob data necessary for validation is actually
    slower for the last 5% of validators with PeerDAS than without.**
  - Mainnet without PeerDAS: The latency increases linearly with the number of
    blobs. This trend covers the entire distribution and is visible from p5 to
    p99 values. Additionally, p99s are at or above the 4 s deadline for all blob
    counts; p99 for 9 blobs is even greater than 5 s.
  - Mainnet with PeerDAS-BPO1: The linearly increasing trend persists with
    PeerDAS and is visible across the plot from top to bottom for all values
    from p5 to p99. The latency is slightly improved for most nodes with PeerDAS
    compared to without since most p50 and p75 values are improved by 100-200
    ms. However, the unluckiest 1% of validators experience worse block latency
    with PeerDAS since the p99 values are all worse for blob count ≥ 3. The p99
    values are all greater than 5 s for blob count ≥ 9, greater than 6 s for 14
    blobs, and it even reaches 12.4 s for the max blob count of 15.
  - Hoodi with PeerDAS-BPO2: There is a clear increasing trend for blob count ≥
    9 values that appear mostly linear for all p1 to p99. This indicates that
    the trend may likely remain linearly increasing on Mainnet once BPO2 is
    deployed.
- **Attestation rate: Clear impact of blob count on attestation rate.**
  - Mainnet without PeerDAS: A higher blob count increases p99 of failed
    attestation rate for blob count ≥ 4. The blob count barely impacts
    attestation rate otherwise.
  - Mainnet with PeerDAS-BPO1: Failed attestation rate is overall significantly
    worse with PeerDAS than without. p75 before PeerDAS is stable at 0.6% across
    all blob counts but it increases from 0.9% to 1.8% as the blob count
    increases after PeerDAS. Similarly, p95 increases from 2.4% for 1 blob to 7%
    for 15 blobs.
  - Hoodi with PeerDAS-BPO2: The failed attestation rate increases linearly with
    the number of blobs for blob count ≥ 14. The median rate of validators that
    do not attest finalized blocks goes from 4% for 14 blobs to 5% for 21 blobs,
    and p99 goes from 11% for 14 blobs to 37% for 21 blobs.
- **Orphan block rate: Little to no impact of blob count on orphan block rate.**
  - Mainnet without PeerDAS: The results are inconclusive. One plot computing
    the orphan rate based on the total number of slots (the absolute rate) shows
    patterns indicating a correlation between blob count increases and orphan
    rate increases. However, the second plot that computes the orphan rate based
    on the number of finalized blocks containing the same number of blobs —
    i.e., the proportional rate — does not show any pattern.
  - Mainnet with PeerDAS-BPO1: Orphans are rare, and there is not enough data
    yet.
  - Hoodi with PeerDAS-BPO2: There does not appear to be a correlation between
    blob count and rate of orphan blocks on Hoodi. The plot showing absolute
    rate mostly highlights two outlier values, while the plot showing
    proportional rate mostly highlights the pattern seen on block latency
    between 6 and 13 blobs.

### Mainnet Latency Comparison

![CDF of block validation latency](/peerdas-propagation/validation-cdf-complete.png)

**Description**. This plot shows the evolution of the fraction of validators
that have received enough data to validate a block on Mainnet with Pectra versus
with Fusaka rules when there are 1, 5, and 9 blobs in a block. More precisely,
it depicts the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the block validation
latency that we define as the earliest time at which a validator is able to
validate a block according to the consensus rules. In order to validate a block,
a validator in Pectra must have received the block and all its blob sidecars,
while it must only receive the block and at least 8 blob columns, including all
the blob columns it must custody, under Fusaka rules. The details of the Pectra
and Fusaka datasets — Mainnet before PeerDAS and Mainnet with PeerDAS-BPO1,
respectively — are explained further in the description of their respective
latency plots.

**Takeaways**. All three pairs of lines, when paired by blob count, exhibit a
similar pattern: most validators can verify blocks earlier in Fusaka compared to
Pectra, i.e., the dashed line is mostly above the solid line. Additionally,
adding blobs in a block naturally adds latency. We observe a slight slump in the
dissemination around 2.3-2.5 s that may be due to cross-continental latencies
between dense clusters of validators.

![Zoomed in CDF of block validation latency](/peerdas-propagation/validation-cdf-zoomed.png)

**Description**. This plot is a zoomed version of the above plot, with lines for
3 and 7 blobs added, to highlight the beginning of the tail of the
disseminations, past p95.

**Takeaways**. The behavior of the pair of lines for 1 blob remains consistent
with the above plot: more than 99% of the validators are able to verify blocks
faster under Fusaka than under Pectra when the blob count is that low.
**However, the behavior is reversed for higher blob counts**: the unluckiest
4-5% validators actually require more time to receive the validation data with
Fusaka than with Pectra. The trend worsens as the blob count increases as shown
by the gap between the solid and dashed lines of the same color. These two plots
show that PeerDAS has improved latency for 95% of the validators but worsened
latency for the remaining minority.

![CDF of blob propagation latency](/peerdas-propagation/blob-latency-cdf-complete.png)

![Zoomed in CDF of blob propagation latency](/peerdas-propagation/blob-latency-cdf-zoomed.png)

**Description**. These two plots mimic the above plots but focus on the
latencies for validators to receive enough blob data to validate blocks, i.e.,
all blobs for each block in Pectra compared to only the required blob columns in
Fusaka. These plots do not consider block latencies, only blob column latencies.

**Takeaways**. These two plots confirm the previous deduction that most nodes
receive blob data faster in Fusaka than in Pectra, that it is the opposite at
the tail, for the unluckiest 5%, and that the trend worsens as the blob count
increases.

#### Before PeerDAS

![Boxplot](/peerdas-propagation/mainnet-pectra-latency-boxplot.png)

**Description**. This plot shows the distribution of block discovery &
validation latencies on Mainnet under Pectra (before PeerDAS) depending on the
number of blobs referenced in each block. As mentioned above, Pectra requires
validators to download all blob sidecars referenced in a block in order to
validate it. That latency is visible in the difference between discovery and
validation latencies. Each data point of the plot is a unique tuple: (receiving
node, finalized block). Block latencies higher than 30s have been filtered out
to remove obvious outliers. The dataset is aggregated over the whole month of
November 2025. The black vertical line at the 4s mark indicates the block
attestation deadline.

**Takeaways**. There is a clearly visible increasing trend for all metrics from
p25 up to p99, indicating that a higher blob count leads to a higher block
validation latency. The p99s are already at the 4s deadline for 0-1 blobs and
are above that deadline for all blobs ≥ 2, yet the validators are expected to
not only receive but also process the block and its associated blobs by that
deadline.

#### With PeerDAS-BPO1

![Boxplot](/peerdas-propagation/mainnet-bpo1-latency-boxplot.png)

**Description**. This plot replicates the previous latency plot on Mainnet but
after PeerDAS and BPO1 have been deployed. In addition, it shows the _block
discovery latency_, as the first box for every level. This makes the added
latency purely from blob column propagation more clear.

As mentioned above, the validation rules for Fusaka are different and require a
validator to not download full blobs but instead at least 8 blob columns,
including all the blob columns it requires to custody. The 11-day sampling
period ranges from 2025-12-10 00:00 UTC, soon after the activation of BPO1, to
2025-12-21 23:59 UTC.

**Takeaways**. The trend appears similar pre- and post-PeerDAS from p5 to p99.
Interestingly, p50 values are overall improved by 100-200ms post-PeerDAS, but
p99 values are worse for blob count ≥ 3, implying a lower quality of service
experienced by the unluckiest 1% of validators. The p99 values are all greater
than 5s for blob count ≥ 9, reaching 6.1 s for 14 blobs and even 12.4 s for the
max blob count of 15.

### Latency on Hoodi with PeerDAS-BPO2

![Boxplot](/peerdas-propagation/hoodi-bpo2-latency-boxplot.png)

**Description**. This plot depicts block validation latency on Hoodi once
PeerDAS and BPO2 have been deployed. BPO2 has been deployed on 2025-11-12 on
Hoodi and raised the blob count to (target, max) of `(14, 21)`. The data used
for this plot has been sampled over 7 days, from 2025-11-28 00:00:00 UTC to
2025-12-04 00:00:00 UTC, compared to a month for Mainnet because of the much
higher volatility observed on the Hoodi testnet.

**Takeaways**. The impact of blob count on block latency is not as clear on
Hoodi as it is on Mainnet. There is a clear increasing trend that appears mostly
linear for blob count ≥ 9 for all p1 to p99 values. We observed that a lot of
nodes were not receiving enough blob columns to verify blocks, hence
artificially reducing the overall latency because only successful validations
are taken into account in the plot.

### Attestation Rates

#### Mainnet before PeerDAS [#mainnet-before-peerdas-attestations]

![Boxplot](/peerdas-propagation/mainnet-pectra-attestations-boxplot.png)

**Description**. This plot shows the fraction of validators that never attested
to a block depending on the number of blobs in that block. Each data point
corresponds to a finalized block. For instance, a p99 of 30% means that 1% of
the blocks are attested by only 70% of the validators. The data is aggregated
over the whole month of November 2025 on Mainnet. The x-axis of the plot is
split into two linear axes of different scales to improve the readability of
both boxes and whiskers.

**Takeaways**. There is a very light increasing trend on the median and a more
visible trend on p99 for blob count ≥ 4. The p75 values are all close to or
below 0.6% of failed attestation rate, which indicates a stable network even for
a blob count of 9.

#### Mainnet with PeerDAS-BPO1 [#mainnet-with-peerdas-bpo1-attestations]

![Boxplot](/peerdas-propagation/mainnet-bpo1-attestations-boxplot.png)

**Description**. This plot replicates the above attestation rate on Mainnet but
after PeerDAS is activated and up until BPO1 activation. The plot is similarly
split in two for readability.

**Takeaways**. Most importantly, the attestation rate overall worsens: p75
before PeerDAS hovers around 0.6% of failed attestation rate while it goes from
0.9% to 1.8% as the blob count increases once PeerDAS activates. All
measurements from p50 up to p99 depict a similar trend: blocks have worse
attestation rates as the blob count increases. The attestation rate is much more
impacted by the blob count in this plot, with PeerDAS, than in the previous
plot, without PeerDAS.

#### Hoodi with PeerDAS-BPO2 [#hoodi-with-peerdas-bpo2-attestations]

![Boxplot](/peerdas-propagation/hoodi-bpo2-attestations-boxplot.png)

**Description**. This plot replicates the above plot on attestation rate but on
Hoodi with BPO2 activated. The data has only been sampled over a week because of
the much higher volatility observed Hoodi compared to Mainnet; in some cases,
increasing the sample size increases the presence of outliers.

**Takeaways**. There is a clear increasing trend starting at 12 blobs where all
measures above p25 visibly worsen as blob count increases. Additionally, p99
worsen across the board as the blob count increases. Compared to Mainnet before
PeerDAS and its p75 below 1%, the p75 is much worse on Hoodi with PeerDAS and
ranges between 5% and 7% instead.

### Orphan Block Rates

#### Mainnet before PeerDAS [#mainnet-before-peerdas-orphans]

**Absolute**

![Mainnet before PeerDAS orphan rate](/peerdas-propagation/mainnet-pectra-orphans-absolute.png)

**Description**. This plot depicts the orphan block rate categorized by the
number of blobs referenced in these blocks. These orphan blocks have been
created by the expected proposer of their respective slots but, for unspecified
reasons, did not end in the finalized chain of blocks. These rates are computed
proportional to the total number of slots in the sampling period: 216,000 slots
in November 2025.

**Takeaways**. The overall orphan rate is low at 584 / 216000 = 0.27%, which
indicates an “uptime” of 99.73% for Ethereum. We observe two patterns in this
plot. First, a pattern appears to repeat every 3 rows where a high value for a
row is followed by two lower values: 63 orphans for 0 blobs followed by 11 and 1
orphans for the next two rows, 71 orphans for 3 blobs followed by 30 and 22
orphans for the next rows, and similarly for 6-9 blobs. The second pattern shows
that increasing the blob count increases the orphan rate but only once we
consider the first pattern. The increasing trend is clear when only observing
blob counts of 0, 3, 6, and 9. The confidence in this second interpretation is
lowered due to our inability to explain the first pattern.

**Proportional**

![Mainnet before PeerDAS orphan rate](/peerdas-propagation/mainnet-pectra-orphans-proportional.png)

**Description**. This plot replicates the above absolute orphan rate plot but
changes the divisors used in the rate computation. This plot shows
“proportional” rates in that they are based on the number of finalized blocks
that have the same blob count as the orphan blocks.

**Takeaways**. We mainly observe a diverse distribution of blob count in
finalized blocks (the divisors in the fraction next to the bars) and two
outliers at 2 and 9 blobs. With outliers ignored, the blob count does not appear
to impact the orphan rate, unlike in the plot showing absolute orphan rate.

#### Mainnet with PeerDAS-BPO1 [#mainnet-with-peerdas-bpo1-orphans]

It would take several weeks to gather enough data to generate a plot for Mainnet
post-Fusaka. For comparison, the above plot showing orphan blocks on Mainnet
before PeerDAS depicts a small amount of orphan rate despite being computed over
a whole month. The data below shows a very small number of observations for the
higher blob counts, so is not indicative. The 15 blob outliers do stand out with
an orphan rate of >5%.

![Mainnet with PeerDAS-BPO1 orphan rate](/peerdas-propagation/mainnet-bpo1-orphans-proportional.png)

#### Hoodi with PeerDAS-BPO2 [#hoodi-with-peerdas-bpo2-orphans]

**Absolute**

![Hoodi with PeerDAS-BPO2 orphan rate](/peerdas-propagation/hoodi-bpo2-orphans-absolute.png)

**Description**. This plot depicts the rate of orphan blocks on Hoodi as a
fraction of the total number of slots in the sampling period: 50,400 slots in 7
days.

**Takeaways**. The overall orphan rate over the sampling period is low at 319 /
50400 (orphans / total slots) = 0.63%, which is marginally higher than the 0.27%
of Mainnet. There are two clear outliers, for 0 blobs and 21 blobs, and there
does not appear to be any clear trend indicating an impact of the blob count on
the rate of orphan blocks in Hoodi.

**Proportional**

![Hoodi with PeerDAS-BPO2 orphan rate](/peerdas-propagation/hoodi-bpo2-orphans-proportional.png)

**Description**. This plot shows the rate of orphan blocks on Hoodi over a week
as a fraction of the number of finalized blocks that have the same blob count.

**Takeaways**. There is a notable surge of the orphan rate between 6 and 13
blobs; we have no explanation for this event. The value for 0 blobs is a clear
outlier, and the value for 21 blobs can be treated as an outlier due to very
high divisor, between 4 and 46x larger than for other blob counts. Once the last
row of 21 blobs is discarded as an outlier, there is no clear trend indicating a
correlation between blob count and rate of orphan blocks.

    correctness” metric in the reports) goes up to more than 50% for full nodes
    as the blob count increases from 10 to 40. Super nodes are mostly fine. The
    p75 latency for 50-60 blobs per block reaches 3 s so the tail is much higher
    (unclear in reports). Sampled columns are hard to get with 60+ blobs per
    block, likely due to network contention: too much bandwidth is required for
    the execution client and the consensus client struggles to respond to column
    requests.

    Fusaka devnet 5 with 1,700 nodes (1/8 of mainnet): The bottleneck for high
    blob count is the full node uplink due to the high number of blobs in the
    mempool (execution client), while the bandwidth for super nodes is mostly in
    sampled columns (consensus client).

## 🌱 Proposal: Seeding network

As highlighted in the analysis, PeerDAS negatively impacts a number of
measurements related to consensus stability, especially at the tail. On its own,
for small bumps in blob counts with upcoming BPO’s, this shouldn’t be cause for
alarm. However, in the PBS supply chain, milliseconds matter. Relays offer
services for validators to delay committing to a block for as long as possible,
to maximize MEV (timing games). This works because as of today, the latency
penalty for including blobs is relatively minimal. As we’ve seen above however,
that’s already changing, which may lead some entities in the PBS supply chain to
impose artificial ceilings on the blob limit that are way below the _actual_
limit. This would counteract the DA scaling benefits that are PeerDAS’ main
raison d'être.

**What.** Because of this, we propose to build a global network of supernodes
whose only task is to accelerate the propagation of data (blocks and blobs) from
the block originator (relay in PBS) to the rest of the network. We expect the
seeding network to reliably reduce and stabilize the latency experienced by
validators by reducing and bounding the number of communication hops required to
disseminate data to most validators. It will additionally improve blob usage
efficiency by ensuring that builders can reliably include the economically
optimal number of blobs without any additional latency penalties.

The concept of seeding network is aligned with the
[Rainbow staking framework](https://ethresear.ch/t/18683) (albeit out of
protocol) as it relies on more powerful supernodes to contribute more to the
network than regular nodes, ultimately improving the quality of service for
everyone. These supernodes extend the idea of _DAS providers_ as described in
the [original PeerDAS post](https://ethresear.ch/t/16541#das-providers-13). A
[couple](https://notes.ethereum.org/NgKvvYiAQ7WdxPECCVdGUQ) of
[designs](https://ethresear.ch/t/21758) have proposed for PBS relays to become
DAS providers and to offer an RPC service that validators can query to obtain
samples. We propose to extend these designs with an additional support for
GossipSub in order for supernodes to proactively accelerate data dissemination
instead of only being passive actors waiting for client queries.

**How**. This seeding network will be composed of highly performant and highly
connected supernodes that will act as network hubs in order to deliver as much
data to as many nodes as possible. Supernodes will contribute to the
dissemination of block and blob columns by subscribing to the GossipSub topics
used for blocks (`beacon_block`) and for the 128 blob column subnets
(`data_column_sidecar_[0-127]`). Additionally, supernodes will reply to the
relevant RPC requests for blocks, blobs and blob columns, e.g.,
`BeaconBlocksByRoot`, `BlobSidecarsByRoot`, `DataColumnSidecarsByRange`.

The inter-supernode connections will be implemented the battle-tested, highly
performant https://github.com/chainbound/msg-rs that powered our low-latency
mempool service
[Fiber](https://research.chainbound.io/fiber-vs-bloxroute-the-standoff). The
geographical placement of each supernode and the topology of the network will be
designed to minimize overall dissemination and request latencies for the
validators, ensuring proper distribution in hotspots such as Virginia, Frankfurt
and Tokyo.

### Expected Metric Improvements

We expect the seeding network to have clear improvements on the Ethereum network
in terms of:

1. **Block and blob reception latency**: A small network of high-performance
   supernodes enables dissemination with fewer hops than a larger and more
   heterogeneous network does.
2. **Attestation rate and orphan block rate**: Thanks to a faster dissemination
   of both blocks and blob columns, validators will be able to attest blocks
   faster, hence reducing the probability that blocks fail to be attested in
   time and end up as unproductive orphans instead of being part of the
   finalized chain.
3. **Reduction of strategic blob limiting in PBS**: Because of the above 2
   improvements, the benefits of strategic (lower) blob inclusion in the PBS
   supply chain are nullified.

### ePBS (Glamsterdam)

**Source**:
[[high-level description]](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7732-the-case-for-inclusion-in-glamsterdam/24306)

**Problem**: A 12 s slot may be too small to do all the downloading and
verification that validators do before attesting a block.

**Proposal**: Minimize what information is downloaded and verified (i.e., only
the consensus block) during the slot that the block is proposed in, and tolerate
a delay of up to an additional slot to perform the rest of the download and
verification (e.g., blobs, execution payloads).

**Expected result**: Better attestation rate, particularly for blocks with high
blob count.

**Readiness**: Headliner for Glamsterdam.

**Compatibility with seeding network**: Compatible but greatly reduces the need
to reduce block and blob delivery latency. However, ePBS does not impact the
motivation regarding bandwidth or reduced slot duration.

### Sparse blobpool (Maybe Glamsterdam?)

**Source**:
[[EIP draft]](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-8070.md)
[[older ethresearch post with similar ideas]](https://ethresear.ch/t/is-data-available-in-the-el-mempool/22329)

**Problem**: The network bandwidth of the execution client overshadows that of
the consensus client when the blob count increases towards high dozens, e.g.,
68% of the bandwidth is used by the execution client for blob (target, max) of
(48, 72).

**Proposal**: Perform blob sampling on the execution client as well, in addition
to PeerDAS doing sampling on the consensus client. The sampling done by the two
clients is aligned: the execution client queries the network for the columns
needed for the consensus client. The probability of sampling a blob could
theoretically be set independently by each full node, but the authors propose a
single network-wide parameter to ensure enough nodes have full blobs.

**Expected result**: By only downloading full blobs 15% of the time and sampling
85% of the time, the execution client reduces by 75% its bandwidth consumption.

**Readiness**: Proposed for integration into Glamsterdam
[[list update]](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/10651).

**Compatibility with seed network**: Good. Sparse blobpools reduce remote
queries for full blobs so a seed network would be less useful but not useless
since a lot of blob data is still downloaded.

### Sharded blob mempool

**Source**: [[ethresearch post]](https://ethresear.ch/t/22537)

**Problem**: (1) Blobs downloaded by execution clients incur a high network
bandwidth, (2) gossiped data related to blobs received by both consensus and
execution clients may be redundant, and (3) consensus clients download complete
columns while the execution client may already have a subset of them.

**Proposal**: Better synergy between consensus and execution clients by: (1)
Sharding the blob mempool such that execution clients only download a subset of
it (e.g., 16 in the proposal) and it must be the same rows custodied by the
consensus client, (2) having only the execution client disseminate the blob
rows, (3) enabling partial column queries to avoid having consensus clients
downloading what they already have. The idea behind sharded blob mempool is
similar to sparse blobpool in the sense that it makes consensus and execution
clients work better together.

**Expected result**: Reduced bandwidth and latency required to validate blocks.

**Readiness**: High-level description post.

**Compatibility with seed network**: Good. The proposal reduces the overall
network bandwidth so a seed network would be less useful but not useless.

### Future of DAS

**Main source:**
[[Ethresearch summary of various combinations of commitments and coding]](https://ethresear.ch/t/22298)

**Other sources**: [[FullDAS ethresearch post]](https://ethresear.ch/t/19529)
[[FullDASv2 ethresearch post]](https://ethresear.ch/t/22477)
[[a16z post on using Pederson commitments with IPA instead of KZG]](https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/an-overview-of-danksharding-and-a-proposal-for-improvement-of-das/)

**Problem**: PeerDAS applies Reed-Solomon coding separately per blob, in what is
called 1D coding and sampling, and a future goal is to move towards 2D coding
and sampling for greater resilience to blob data loss. The problem is how to
best design this second dimension of coding.

**Proposal**: FullDAS and FullDASv2 are similar to PeerDAS in that
Reed-Solomon + KZG are used for the second dimension as well.

The summary post explores how to do cell-level DAS several combinations of
commitment schemes — namely Merkle trees, KZG commitments, and Pedersen
commitments — and coding schemes — namely Reed-Solomon, random linear codings
(RLCs), and random linear network codings (RLNCs). The summary concludes that
using KZG commitments may not be the best option for the second dimension due to
the high computational cost incurred on every node that forwards the samples,
which would reduce propagation at every step. Merkle trees may be the most
viable for fast propagation.

**Expected result**: Reduce the amount of data required to validate blocks.

**Readiness**: Descriptive posts.

**Compatibility with seed network**: Perfect. 2D coding and sampling mean more
data to transmit and an even slower seeding, making the seed network even more
relevant.

### RLNC-DAS by Optimum

**Source**: [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21586)

**Problem**: PeerDAS has a small CPU footprint on the proposers that must
perform additional computation and a big networking footprint for proposers and
supernodes.

**Proposal**: Replace PeerDAS’ mechanisms based on KZG commitments and
Reed-Solomon coding that are computed once at block building time with Pederson
commitments generated once at block building time and later random linear
network coding (RLNC) that is done on the fly by full/supernodes as clients
query them for blob samples. RLNC codes are therefore not broadcast on the
network; there is no network overhead during broadcast since only the payload of
blobs is broadcast.

**Expected result**: Much better network bandwidth footprint for sampling
clients (10x better than PeerDAS) and zero storage overhead. The main downside
is the increased CPU and network footprint for full nodes, which appears to
scale linearly with the number of querying clients but is unfortunately not
evaluated.

**Readiness**: Prototype with unreleased code and public tech report.

**Compatibility with seeding network**: Incompatible. RLNC-DAS is completely
different from PeerDAS. It is designed to minimize the amount of broadcast data
while the proposed seeding network strives for scenarios with a lot of broadcast
data. It is compatible with supernodes since the CPU footprint grows linearly on
a node with the number of clients that query blob samples.
